# Tele Nav: ROS 2 Navigation

**Tele Nav** is a project that explores the capabilities of ROS 2. All documentation used to build the robots can be found in the `/Doku` directory.

The main project, developed for a university thesis (**Studienarbeit**), is located in the `/project_ws` directory. Other workspaces were used for learning ROS 2.

This repository is built on **ROS 2 Humble**, which requires **Ubuntu 22.04.05 LTS**. Detailed installation instructions for this setup can be found in the `/doku/ros_basics.md` file.

To run the projects, you must first **source the environment**. All the necessary commands to run the projects are also documented in `doku/ros_basics.md`.
