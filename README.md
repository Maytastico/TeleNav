# TeleNav
Repository for the seminar project 'TeleNav': Advanced navigation software for telepresence robots, enabling seamless remote participation and control.



# Setup

1. Run ``setup_packages.sh`` for setting up the environment

2. Add ``source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash`` to **~/.bashrc**

3. To enable autocompletion add ``source /usr/share/colcon_argcomplete/hook/colcon-argcomplete.bash`` to **~/.bashrc**

Before running source the setup.bash.
```bash
source ./install/setup.bash
```

To build the program run:
```bash
colcon build
```

For setting up cpp for vs code you need
to edit **c/c++: Edit Configuration**
Add 
```JSON
"includePath": [
    "${workspaceFolder}/**",
    "/opt/ros/humble/include/**"
],
```

Change this so that it works with your project and add it to your cmakelist.txt
```cmake
find_package(rclcpp REQUIRED)
add_executable(<node_name> src/<node_file_name>.cpp)
ament_target_dependencies(<node_file_name> rclcpp)
install(TARGETS
  <node_file_name>
  DESTINATION lib/${PROJECT_NAME}
)
```
## Create a new Package
After setting up your workspace you are able to create a new package.
For that go into your **/src** folder and run:

* rclpy is a library used almost everywhere in ros so adding as dependency is completly fine

```bash
ros2 pkg create --build-type ament_python first_package --dependencies rclpy
```

## Adding a new script

To run a script trough the ros2 ecosystem you need
to add the script to the **setup.py** file.

An entry can look like this:
The first name is the name registered when initializing the Node.

```python
entry_points={
    'console_scripts': [
        "py_node = my_robot_controller.my_first_node:main",
    ],
},

## Python node template

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import rclpy
from rclpy.node import Node

class MyNode(Node):
    def __init__(self):
        # Calling the init function for the node
        super().__init__("my_node")
        self.get_logger().info("Hello ROS 2")

def main(args=None):
    
    # Starts the ROS 2 node and communicatio
    # Whitout this line, the node will not be able to communicate with the ROS 2 ecosystem
    # and the program will fail
    rclpy.init(args=args)


    # Create a ROS 2 node
    node = MyNode()

    # This will keep the node running until 
    # it is manually stopped
    # These callback will be executed in a loop
    # trough the spin function
    rclpy.spin(node)

    # Shuts down the ROS 2 node
    rclpy.shutdown()

if __name__ == 'main':
    main()
```
# Run
When running the first time it recommended to check for dependencies.
For this run following command:
```bash
rosdep install -i --from-path src  --rosdistro iron -y
```

Now you can run your new package
Run:
```bash
colcon build --packages-select first_package
```
To run your package
```bash
ros2 run <package_name> <application_name>
```
# Notes

## ROS2 CLI

To see all running nodes
* ``ros2 node listt``
* ``ros2 node info /<node_name>``
 
## Running two seperate nodes
When running two seperate nodes the name will be the same so to run one node in parallel
you can remapp it with this command.

```bash
ros2 run <package> <script> --ros-args -r __node:=<name>
```

## Colcon tricks

Building only specific packages
```bash
colcon build --packages-select <package_name>
```

Symlink installing a package to build everytime is is runc over ros2 run.
It works only with python!
```bash
colcon build --packages-select <package_name> --symlink-install
```
## Topics

There are several arguments you can add to get more info:
* **bw** - Bamdbreite eines Channels
* **hz** - Fequenz eines Channels
* **echo** - Ausgabe was im Channel Ã¼bertragen wird
With `ros2 interface`you can gather info about an interface definition
```bash
ros2 interface show esample_interfaces/msg/String
```

To see all the topics that are currently running you can run:
```bash
ros2 topic list
```


To see the messages that are being published on a topic you can run:
```bash
ros2 topic echo /topic_name
```

To send messages to a topic you can run:
The topictype is ussauly std_msgs/msg/String
```bash
ros2 topic pub /topic_name topic_type "message"
```

To get more information about a topic you can run:
```bash
ros2 topic info /topic_name --verbose
```
## Services

To list all the services enter
```bash
ros2 service list
```

To call a specific service you need to call it over.
Interface types can be found in `example_interface`.
```bash
ros2 service call /<service_path> <interface> "{example: "data"}"
```
## Create a interface package

Use the ros2 pkg comand to create a simple cpp package.
Delete `src` and `include` afterwards.
Add following lines to `package.xml` under **buildtool_depend**
```bash
<build_depend>rosidl_default_runtime</build_depend>
<build_depend>rosidl_default_generators</build_depend>
<member_of_group>rosidl_interface_packages</member_of_group>
```

Then add this to your **CMakeLists.xml**
Depending on your message definition add the files to rosidl_generate_interfaces
```cmake
# find dependencies
find_package(ament_cmake REQUIRED)
find_package(rosidl_default_generators REQUIRED)
rosidl_generate_interfaces(${PROJECT_NAME}
    "msg/HardwareStatus.msg"
)
ament_export_dependencies(rosidl_default_runtime)
```

When using your new interface it is important to use the packagename
from the package you created
e.q from my_robot_interface.msg impoer HardwareMessages

When the package is not present add the path of the installfolder of the package to your
**setting.json** 
e.q 
```json
    "python.autoComplete.extraPath":{
        "path to python path"
    }
```



## Create a package with urdf files
This explaines how to create a package with urdf files.
urdf is used to describe the geometry of the robot model.
```bash
mkdir launch urdf
```

* Add you urdf model to urdf_test/urdf/model.urdf
* create a launch file in launch folder with following content:
```python
import launch
from launch.substitutions import Command, LaunchConfiguration
import launch_ros
import os

def generate_launch_description():
    # This automatically finds the path to the urdf package
    pkgPath = launch_ros.substitutions.FindPackageShare(package='urdf_test').find('urdf_test')

    # This is the path to the urdf model
    urdfModelPath = os.path.join(pkgPath, 'urdf', 'robot.urdf')

    with open(urdfModelPath, 'r') as infp:
        robotDescription = infp.read()

    params = {'robot_description': robotDescription}

    robot_state_publisher_node = launch_ros.actions.Node(
        package='robot_state_publisher',
        executable='robot_state_publisher',
        output='screen',
        parameters=[params]
    )
    
    joint_state_publisher_node = launch_ros.actions.Node(
        package='joint_state_publisher',
        executable='joint_state_publisher',
        output='screen',
        parameters=[params],
        condition=launch.conditions.UnlessCondition(LaunchConfiguration('gui'))
    )

    joint_state_publisher_gui_node = launch_ros.actions.Node(
        package='joint_state_publisher_gui',
        executable='joint_state_publisher_gui',
        name='joint_state_publisher_gui',
        condition=launch.conditions.IfCondition(LaunchConfiguration('gui'))
    )

    rviz_node = launch_ros.actions.Node(
        package='rviz2',
        executable='rviz2',
        name='rviz2',
        output='screen',
    )

    return launch.LaunchDescription([
        launch.actions.DeclareLaunchArgument(
            'gui',
            default_value='True',
            description='This is a flag for the joint_state_publisher_gui'
        ),
        launch.actions.DeclareLaunchArgument(
            name='model',
            default_value=urdfModelPath,
            description='Path to the urdf model file'
        ),
        robot_state_publisher_node,
        joint_state_publisher_node,
        joint_state_publisher_gui_node,
        rviz_node
    ])
```
* To launch build the repository and run:
```bash
ros2 launch urdf_test display.launch.py
```
